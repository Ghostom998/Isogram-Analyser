    CONSOLE APPLICATION : ReadFileTest Project Overview
========================================================================

Are you making a game like hangman? or otherwise need to sort a large list of words into

isograms, but dont have the patience to sift through yourself?

OR dont trust your own judgement?


This program will run through a .txt file of words with a file name of the users choice.

The words need to be seperated by a newline character.

The algorithm will sort words that are isograms into a new file (name must be different to input file)

and display words to the console that are not isograms.


Of course, the code is open source so you could ammend the parameters to suit your situation!
